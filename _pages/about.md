## Who Am I?
Hello! I am Nicole, a third-year engineering honors student at UT Austin, majoring in Biomedical Engineering on Track 4 (Molecular, Cellular, and Tissue Biomechanics). My current interests include coding, medical device development, and prosthetics. I am very passionate and creative, often finding myself falling in love with different activities such as swimming, Jiu-Jitsu, musicals, drawing, painting, crocheting, and sewing. I love exploring different fields and getting to meet new people!

## Editing

### Posts

* Add, update, or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Collections
To display products, Supply uses a collection called ```product```
You will find a series of product samples in the `_products` collection folder. By design, all the products are on display on the home page, in Supply, that is `Ã¬ndex.html`.
You can manually create pages based on this index to [sort your products or any other collection by custom variable](/custom-variables/).

You can also add your products in regular posts, using the Gumroad [overlay](/gumroad-overlay/), [embed](/gumroad-embed/), and [hyperlinks](/gumroad-hyperlink/) method, thanks to an include snippet.

Write something like:

```html
{% raw %}<a href="https://gum.co/supply class="no-underline pv2 grow db"><img class="w-100" src="/images/screenshot.png"></a>

{% include gumroad-overlay.html id="supply" %}{% endraw %}
```

to get a product display like this:

<a href="https://gum.co/supply" class="no-underline pv2 grow db"><img class="w-100" src="/images/supply-overlay.png"></a>
